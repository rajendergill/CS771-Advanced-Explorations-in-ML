# Prerequisites for Task 1 :-1.	Python: Version 3.8 or higher2.	PyTorch: Version 2.0 or higher3.	Torchvision: Version 0.15 or higher4.	Pillow: Version 9.0 or higher5.	NumPy: Version 1.22 or higher# Dataset Paths for Task 1:-Update the dataset path from the cell 8 line no. 2 and 3 from task1.ipynb file so you can run Task 1 code. # Prerequisites for Task 2 :-1.	Python: Version 3.8 or higher2.	PyTorch: Version 2.0 or higher3.	Torchvision: Version 0.15 or higher4.	Pillow: Version 9.0 or higher5.	NumPy: Version 1.22 or higher# Dataset Paths for Task 2:-Update the dataset path from the cell 5 line no. 12, 14 and 16 from task2.ipynb file so you can run Task 2 code. # Path Update of Models file generated from task1.ipynb file to run task2.ipynb :-I have given the models_task1.pth file you need to put that file to the same directory where you put dataset file or you generate the models by running the task1 code and put the path in cell 2 line no. 2 in task2.ipnb file so you can run the Task 2 code.
