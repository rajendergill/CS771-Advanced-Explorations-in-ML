# Advanced Exploration in Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning and deep learning projects developed as part of academic coursework and self-initiated exploration. The projects cover supervised classification, feature fusion, continual learning, and deep learning model implementations.

## üìå Project 1: Binary Classification & Multi-Feature Learning
- **Description:**  
  Developed binary classification models using three different feature representations: Emoticons, Deep Features, and Text Sequences. Implemented feature engineering, model selection, and dataset fusion techniques to optimize classification performance.  

- **Approach:**  
  - Trained individual models on each dataset (CNN, LSTM, CNN+GRU).  
  - Conducted experiments with training subsets (20%‚Äì100%) to analyze learning curves.  
  - Performed feature fusion across datasets, using Random Forest to improve generalization.  

- **Results:**  
  - CNN on Emoticons ‚Üí **93.05% accuracy**  
  - LSTM on Deep Features ‚Üí **98.36% accuracy**  
  - CNN+GRU on Text Sequences ‚Üí **93.05% accuracy**  
  - Random Forest on combined dataset ‚Üí **93.05% accuracy**  

- **How to Run:**  
  1. Place `51.py`, `model1.py`, `model2.py`, `model3.py`, and `combine_model.py` in the same directory.  
  2. Copy dataset files (`.csv`, `.npz`) into the same directory.  
  3. Run `51.py` to generate prediction files:  
     - `pred_emoticon.txt`  
     - `pred_deepfeat.txt`  
     - `pred_textseq.txt`  
     - `pred_combined.txt`

## üìå Project 2: Continual Learning for CIFAR-10
- **Description:**  
  Built a continual learning framework for CIFAR-10 image classification using LwP (Learning with Pseudo-labels) classifiers. The goal was to adapt models incrementally to new datasets without retaining past data, while handling distribution shifts.  

- **Approach:**  
  - Trained on labeled dataset D1, then iteratively updated models f1‚Äìf10 using pseudo-labeling on unlabeled datasets D2‚ÄìD10.  
  - Incorporated confidence thresholding and techniques from NeurIPS 2021 and ICLR 2023.  
  - Extended framework to D11‚ÄìD20 to test distribution shift adaptability.  
  - Used ConvNeXtBase (pretrained CNN) for robust embeddings.  

- **Results:**  
  - Final model achieved **87.52% accuracy** on D10, demonstrating effective incremental adaptation.  

- **How to Run:**  
  1. For **Task 1**: update dataset paths in `task1.ipynb` (Cell 8, lines 2‚Äì3).  
  2. For **Task 2**: update dataset paths in `task2.ipynb` (Cell 5, lines 12, 14, 16).  
  3. Place `models_task1.pth` in the same directory as dataset files, or regenerate it by running Task 1 before Task 2.
